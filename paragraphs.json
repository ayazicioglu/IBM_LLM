Albekairi4 Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) are pervasive environmental contaminants derived from diverse sources including pyrogenic (e.g., combustion processes), petrogenic (e.g., crude oil), and biological origins. They are commonly found in gasoline, coal, and crude oil, reflecting their prevalence and varied origins in natural and anthropogenic activities. The aim of this study is to use Bacillus tropicus which is a spore-forming, gram-positive and facultative anaerobic bacteria, containing a gene for PACs degradtion. In this study bacterial sample was collected from women's vaginal discharge through streaking and spreading techniques. The DNA was extracted from bacterial culture and then the bacterium was identified through 16S rRNA which appeared to be B.tropicus. Then the computational analysis was conducted where the sequence similarity and functional analysis of alcohol dehydrogenase EutG protein from B.tropicus was analyzed through PSI-BLAT and SMART tool, respectively. The PSI-BLAST showed 100% query coverage score and 9 domains of alcohol dehydrogenase EutG protein were predicted through SMART tool. The quality of the protein was also assessed through ProQ server with a predicted LQ score of 8.091, a Maxsub score of - 0.350 and a z score of - 10.76.",

The Ramachandran plot also predicted its quality and showed that 93.8% residues were in the most favored region. After this, 3D stucture of PACs were obtained from PubChem and molecular docking of the protein was performed with each of the compound. The lowest energy of - 10.3 was obtained with Indeno[1,2,3cd] pyrene and the best docked complex was visulaized through discover studio to analyze its binding residues. Lastly, in-silico site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed which showed that the EutG gene (codes for alcoholic dehydrogenase) obtained from B. tropicus, will not get altered or have any decreasing effect on the enzyme's stability if it goes through any mutations. This suggests that B. tropicus can act as an efficient, non-virulent, and reliable candidate for the eco-friendly and costeffective bioremediation of PACs.

PACs can be produced as complex mixtures or as separate compounds and they naturally occur in fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal etc. Natural events like volcanic eruptions and wildfires emit PACs in large amounts. Burning of woods and garbage is also a major cause of its release into the environment3. The toxicity of these compounds affects mammals, aquatic life, terrestrial invertebrates and growth of plants. These compounds are difficult to degrade and can stay for a longer period of time in the environment, thereby, affecting the quality of the environment4.

There are many ways in which people are exposed to PACs like consuming grilled meat or smoked seafood6. Others include, inhaling polluted air, drinking tainted water, absorption of PACs through skin from the contaminated soil and exposure at places where PACs are released. Some PACs are associated with cancers and can also affect a person's immune system as well as reproductive system7. There are four methods that are used for the removal of PACs from the environment which include physical, chemical, biological and combined methods8. Physical methods include membrane filtration, floatation and adsorption whereas chemical treatment method includes chemical precipitation, chemical oxidation, electrochemical technologies etc. These treatment methods are not easily available as they require high cost and work efficiency9. Biological methods include bioremediation which involve the enzymatic pathways and genetic regulations of microorganisms for the degradation of PACs. This is a much safer and effective approach to remediate and clean the environment by the utilization of microorganisms10. Currently many bacterial species such as Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Sphingomonas, Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, Ralstonia etc. are used for degrading PACs. However, these combined methods involves the combination of all useful techniques at the same time11.

Their remarkable adaptability has made them valuable in the degradation and remediation of the environmental hazards. Numerous bacteria have been discovered with the ability to degrade polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), with particular emphasis on the degradation of naphthalene and phenanthrene, which has received extensive research attention31. Oxidative degradation of hydrocarbons and their derivatives in ecosystems have been done by various bacteria and fungi32. To explore the potential of Bacillus specie, computational methods were used to examine the binding affinity of polycyclic aromatic compounds. The study aimed to validate the organism's effectiveness and determine the enzyme's selectivity towards different PACs. PAHs, which are aromatic compounds consisting of two or more bonded aromatic rings in various arrangements (linear, angular, or clustered), are known to be hazardous to living organisms and some are potential carcinogens33. PAHs include naphthalene, fluorene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, benzo[a] pyrene and fluoranthene7.

Understanding the specific sources and behaviours of PACs in different environments is critical for implementing targeted remediation efforts and minimizing exposure risks. Additionally, identifying these primary sources in developing countries will help to apply sustainable practices to reduce PAC emissions and protect ecosystems35. In the current study, the B. tropicus strain isolated from the vaginal discharge of the women was identified with respect to morphological and 16S RNA gene sequencing. Despite its known potential in recalcitrant compounds biodegradation, this bacterial strain of the genus Bacillus sp., is reported for its ability to degrade PAHs and its derivatives. In a study conducted by Ni'matuzahroh et al.36, the degradation of naphthalene and phenanthrene by B. subtilis 3KP was investigated. The degradation process involved the formation of 1-hydroxy2-naphthoic acid, salicylic acid, and pyrocatechol as intermediates36. Sonwani et al.37 reported that B. cereus RKS4 was capable of degrading naphthalene. During this degradation process, 2-naphthol and catechol were formed as intermediate products37.

In conclusion, the alcohol dehydrogenase EutG protein has shown significant importance in the bioremediation of PACs. This enzyme has been found to play a critical role in the degradation of PACs, converting it into less toxic compounds. The ability of the EutG protein to efficiently degrade PACs and its derivatives makes it a valuable for environmental bioremediation applications. By harnessing the enzymatic activity of EutG, the harmful effects of PACs contamination can be mitigated, leading to the restoration of polluted environment. The use of EutG protein offers a promising approach for sustainable and eco-friendly remediation strategies targeting PACs.

      "content": "Different bacterial species, including various Bacillus strains, have been explored for their role in PAC degradation due to their resilient enzymatic pathways and metabolic flexibility. Bacillus species, through enzymes initiate the oxidation of PAC rings, facilitating further breakdown of these toxic compounds. In this study, EutG specifically demonstrated functional significance as an alcohol dehydrogenase capable of targeting PAC molecules, with the catalytic mechanism enhanced by site-specific binding that initiates PAC breakdown. This catalytic action creates intermediate products, leading to less toxic byproducts that contribute to reducing environmental pollution. The molecular docking analysis confirmed the formation of a stable complex between EutG and Indeno[1,2,3-cd] pyrene, therefore indicating stronger binding affinity and efficient degradation potential. The observed binding affinities were notable, demonstrating superior interaction strength compared to other PAC-degrading enzymes studied in Bacillus species, underscoring EutG's unique capacity for pollutant breakdown. Furthermore, through in-silico site-directed mutagenesis, it was demonstrated that the complex maintains its stability even after undergoing mutations. These mutations in alcohol dehydrogenase EutG indicate its structural resilience, allowing it to adapt to various environments. Targeted mutations at activesite residues could enhance binding affinity and catalytic activity, enabling more effective PAC degradation. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of alcohol dehydrogenase EutG and offer potential avenues for degrading PAC pollution in the environment.",
